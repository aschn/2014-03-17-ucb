  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    Python is becoming more and more popular in scientific computing,
    and it's a great language for teaching general programming concepts due to
    its easy-to-read syntax. We will be using Python version 2.7.
    Installing all the scientific packages for Python individually can be a bit
    difficult, so we recommend using an all-in-one installer.
  </p>
  <p>
	On all platforms, you can easily install Python 2.7 and all of the necessary scientific packages by installing the free <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution</a>. You can accept all of the defaults for installation <em>except</em> make sure to check the option to "Make Anaconda the default Python".</p>

<h5>Windows</h5>

<p>Windows users will need to complete one last step. After installing both Python and Git Bash, download <a href="{{page.root}}/setup/swc-windows-installer.py">this file</a>, making sure that it has a <code>.py</code> extension on the end when you save it. Next, open Git Bash and type each of these three commands, hitting Return after each one: <code>cd</code>, <code>cd Desktop</code>, <code>python swc-windows-installer.py</code>. You'll see a blinking underscore for a bit, and then eventually you'll once again see a <code>$</code> symbol with the blinking underscore after it. You can close Git Bash at this point.</p>
