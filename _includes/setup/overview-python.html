  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    Python is becoming more and more popular in scientific computing,
    and it's a great language for teaching general programming concepts due to
    its easy-to-read syntax. We will be using Python version 2.7.
    Installing all the scientific packages for Python individually can be a bit
    difficult, so we recommend using an all-in-one installer.
  </p>
  <p>
  Please install <a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/">Enthought
    Canopy</a>. You can either install the Express edition or, better, request and
	install the Academic edition.
  </p>
  <p>Once you have installed Canopy, open the program and answer Yes if the program asks you whether you would like Canopy to be your default Python environment.</p>
