  <h3>Git</h3>

  <p>
    Git is a state-of-the-art version control system. It
    lets you track who made changes to what when and has
    options for easily updating a shared or public version of
    your code on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.

    In addition to the below, you should also head over to <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> and create a free account before the bootcamp.
